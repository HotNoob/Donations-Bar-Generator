How to setup/use
	Download the php file and you can rename it whatever you want
	Make sure your using a webserver that supports/runs php
	Open the file in a text editor like notepad but i suggest using an opensource feature packed text editor like Notepad++
	Edit the code in the config section if you new to stuff like this or if you just dont want to deal with it, but if you are feel free to edit the entire thing.
